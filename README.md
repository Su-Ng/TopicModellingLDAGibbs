# TopicModellingLDAGibbs

In this repository, Machine Learning is employed in R to perform Topic Modelling. We do an analysis of 1053 movies and using the storylines, we classify the storylines into different Topics. Using Machine Learning and NLP, DTM Document Term Matrix was performed to remove numbers, stopwords and punctuation. Stemming, which is the process of achieving the root form of words. After that Topic Modelling was performed using LDA with Gibbs method, we can use a word cloud to visualize the words used in a particular topic and display a table for words for all the topics.
